   title: London's Lost Pneumatic Messaging Tubes
   author: meza
   summary: "It's always nice to know where we're coming from and the problems we're trying to solve today are
    not at all different from the ones our ancestors were solving. Instead of vacuum tubes (mostly), we're
    using digital protocols, but the main idea stays the same. Get information from A to B as quick as possible.
    It's quite fascinating how much we've evolved with our solution, but not the problem. P.S.: I never
    thought these things were real when I saw them on cartoons!"
