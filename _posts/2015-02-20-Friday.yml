   title: "All the ghostly sounds that are lost when you compress to mp3"
   author: "meza"
   summary: "Since I'm involved in mix engineering, I have a home studio setup. People usually never get
   why it's really important for mix engineers to have a "very bloody expensive" set of speakers to work on.
   This shows what is left out of the mp3, and what we can hear over consumer speakers is yet another leap
   like this both in sound, and the stereo image."
