   title: "The queen of code"
   author: "meza"
   summary: "A very good summary of Grace Hopper's life. We can thank her that we are able to write our code in  plain
   English. She created the first ever compiler, which translates English into machine code, thus made it possible for
   software engineering to become popular. On another note, everything she stood for resonates with me well in the sense
   that I never care what you've done in the past or what your colour and gender is.
   It all boils down to \"can you do the job now\" or not?"
