    title: "Doomsday Clock"
    author: "meza"
    summary: |
      There is a signaling system that tells us how close we are to a global nuclear or climate catastrophy.
      Every year, scientists hold a meeting to re-evaluate the situation and adjust the device.
      It was created by some members of the Manhattan project. The 'clock' is a metaphore: The closer the hour is to midnight, the closer we are to a technology induced disaster.
      I wonder when will 'the rise of artificial intelligence' be a part of this system.
