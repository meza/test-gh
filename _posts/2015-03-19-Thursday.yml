   title: "The best interface is no interface"
   author: meza
   summary: "I know that confirmation bias is a factor in this, but it's an interesting article nevertheless.
      It also describes the idea behind Tailored Tunes, and why we're not so keen on creating an app, or any
      interface apart from your global setup. You should be able to use our service without all that
      cumbersome finger movement."
