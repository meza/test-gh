      You see, the directory is just a table that contains the filenames
      in the directory, and the matching inode.
    summary: |
      We tend to take it for granted that a filesystem consists of directories,
      however the truth is: it's not.
      Since @designhorf has finally migrated to the unix world and @matta is
      working with (kicking and breaking) linux computers, it's fair to say it's
      wise to have a basic understanding of how it works.
