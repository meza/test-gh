    title: "The queen of code"
    author: "meza"
    summary: "A very good summary of Grace Hopper's life. We can thank her that we are able to write our code in  plain
    English. She created the first ever compiler, which translates English into machine code, thus made it possible for
    software engineering to become popular. On another note, everything she stood for resonates with me well in the sense
    that I never care what you've done in the past or what your colour and gender is.
    It all boils down to \"can you do the job now\" or not?"

    title: "Selenium Introduction"
    author: "matta"
    summary: "My first article recommendation. This explains the basics of Selenium 2 from how to set it up with your
    IDE to getting your first working test framework up and running. There are some smells in it (variable naming,
    unuseful code, etc.), but it's sufficient to get you off the ground."
