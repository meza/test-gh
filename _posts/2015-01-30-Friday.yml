    title: "How we handle most data writes"
    author: "meza"
    summary: "It's not a short article, but is well worth a read. For Tailored Tunes peeps it's a must read, as the
    playlist share and load monitoring features have a similar architecture. This theory is our best friend when it comes
    to scalability. The article does not account for data (in)consistency which is very important when you write data
    and quickly want to read it back. I'm especially proud of our architecture, as Netflix has just announced that they
    are moving to something we've been using for over a year."
