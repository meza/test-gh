    title: "Coding with your eyes shut. Literally!"
    author: "meza"
    summary: "Florian tells us about how he writes code and blogposts on everyday computers, like
    you and I. The only difference is, that he's blind since birth. The article is very engaging and sheds some light on
    what blind people search for and value in websites they use. It's a very valuable lesson for example, that sounds
    and sound analogies in text can be very helpful, as it can serve as a point of reference. Not to mention the
    importance of keyboard shortcuts. I for one am inspired to create an accessibility mode for Tailored Tunes where
    each function has a distinct and recognizable sound."
