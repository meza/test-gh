Have you ever had the feeling of complete isolation from the world? When you enjoy
your work and the challenges you're facing so much, that you shut everything out
and stare at the screen day in, day out playing happily with the puzzles you might
be facing? The blissful feeling when all there is is you and the challenge.

We feel that all the time! Especially that we have the luxury of working from
wherever and whenever we feel like it, there is absolutely no need for the
occasional reality check. Sounds good, right? We think so too.

However, once every so often we need to step back and realize there's more to life
than code. For some of us it's going out and exchanging ideas over a few drinks,
for some it's simply abandoning all screens and getting closer to nature.

No matter what route we choose to tune out, if our world only consists of work,
we won't be able to connect with others or switch our brains off, and that is
bad. Very bad!

__To remedy this, we've came up with a practice that gives us a little perspective
and a way out.__

> ## Every day, share one - and only one - article with the team and explain why we should read it!

### The rules are:
1. The article has to be either:
 - relevant to our profession or self-development
 - relevant to our everyday lives (significant world politics, etc)
 - creativity booster to the person who's sharing it
2. You have to write a few sentences where you summarise why you chose that particular article
3. Participation is not compulsory, but if you do participate, do it every day!

Simple, right?
It turns out, it's not _that_ simple, and has many side-effects.

### What we've discovered:

#### It makes you re-evaluate your sources
This simple exercise makes you think about your sources. Where to get meaningful
information from? Should I be reading some more interesting materials rather than
browsing 9gag all day long?

#### It boosts your understanding of the world almost instantly
If your sources are right, it's like opening a window to the world. You can finally
see what's going on in your areas of interest. With the help of a good feed aggregator,
it can literally be just one window!

#### It enhances your topics
When you meet people from outside your work reality, you have a huge arsenal of
interesting topics to spark discussions around, and you'll be able to chip in with
meaningful insights to other conversations.

#### It gives you a different perspective
Sometimes all you need for a great idea is just a new perspective of viewing things.
You might be stuck with a legacy technology without even knowing there's something
better. Being up to date with possibilities reduces the risk of growing obsolete.

#### It transforms after-work pub-time
You know the feeling when you go out for a beer or two after work and you continue
to "work"? It's not healthy! With all the articles you haven't chosen for AOTD,
you'll find yourself talking about much more interesting things than work. It's fun!

#### It makes your social media timelines richer
Instead of sharing cat videos, you'll start sharing all the stories you find during the day
that doesn't make the AOTD, but you simply can't keep them unshared.

## So why the blog?

These are only the imminent benefits of this practice, and we're pretty sure it will
yield more in the long run.

After a few days we thought we won't keep this behind closed doors. This blog will
feature our articles in hope that we can give people some interesting things to read.

If you like what you see or get inspired, please drop us a line on twitter [@Tailored-Tunes](http://www.twitter.com/Tailored_Tunes)

Heck, if you want to chip in, send us your recommendations, but then make sure to do so
every day!

### Why not reddit?
